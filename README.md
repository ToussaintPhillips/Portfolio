# Portfolio Website Project

## User Story

### What
In this project, I am building a portfolio website. This digital portfolio will serve as a showcase of my skills, talents, and projects, particularly focusing on web development. It's a dynamic platform that grows alongside my learning journey and professional development.

### Why
The primary goal is to create an effective tool for job searching in the tech industry. A well-crafted portfolio is essential for demonstrating my capabilities to potential employers. It highlights not only the final products of my work but also the thought processes and problem-solving skills behind them. Most importantly, having a portfolio with several deployed web applications is often a prerequisite for even securing an initial interview in many tech companies.

### How
The portfolio will be developed using core web development skills:
- **Flexbox**: To ensure a responsive and modern layout.
- **Media Queries**: To achieve a mobile-friendly design that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **CSS Variables**: For easier theme management and style consistency.

The focus will be on clarity, simplicity, and showcasing deployed projects. As the course progresses, I'll update the portfolio with new projects and skills.

## Sections

1. **About Me**: A brief introduction about myself and my journey in web development.
2. **Projects**: A showcase of various projects I've worked on, with an emphasis on deployed web applications.
3. **Skills**: A rundown of my technical and soft skills.
4. **Contact**: Ways to reach me for professional inquiries or collaborations.
5. **Resume**: A downloadable link to my resume.

## Future Enhancements

As I progress through the boot camp and further in my career, I plan to regularly update and enhance the portfolio. This includes adding new projects, updating my skills section, and incorporating any feedback received.
